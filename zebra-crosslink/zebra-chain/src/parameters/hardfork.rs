//! User-led hardfork rules.
//!
//! Crosslink supports user-led hardforks: rules, supplied in the node config,
//! that activate at a given PoW block height (and BFT certificate height) and
//! terminate a set of finalizers. Over time, user-led hardforks become assumed
//! by the software, so the config rules are merged with a set of rules shipped
//! in the executable (see [`shipped_hardforks`]).
//!
//! The canonical, merged-and-validated set is represented by [`HardForkSchedule`],
//! which is built once at config load and then shared (read-only) with everything
//! that needs it — zebra-state, zebra-consensus and zebra-crosslink.
